* Readme
Open firefox and type ‘;e’, then copy-paste the following link:
#+begin_example
https://gitlab.com/janmasrovira/surfing-keys-config/-/raw/firefox/surfing-keys.js
#+end_example

This branch is needed because firefox is still using version 0.9.74 at this moment.
When the version 1.0 is released it should be compatible with the main branch.
